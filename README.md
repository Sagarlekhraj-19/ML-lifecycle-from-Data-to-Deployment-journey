# From Data to Deployment: A Complete ML Pipeline Journey (S1)

Welcome to Season 1 of my Machine Learning pipeline practical journey 🚀
This repository documents hands-on implementation of concepts I studied during my Machine Learning course, focusing on real-world workflow, clear reasoning, and best practices.

Author: Sagar Lekhraj
Goal: To deeply understand and demonstrate each step of an end‑to‑end ML pipeline — from raw data to a clean, model‑ready dataset.

.

# 📌 Project Overview

Machine Learning is not just about training models — it is a process. This series breaks the ML pipeline into clear, practical steps so learners can understand why each step exists and how it impacts the final model.

# In Season 1, we focus on:

Understanding data

Loading datasets

Handling missing values

Building strong preprocessing foundations

Future seasons will cover EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Evaluation, Deployment, and Monitoring.

# ML Pipeline Steps Covered (Season 1)

Data Understanding

Data Loading

Data Cleaning

Missing Value Handling

(EDA, Modeling & Deployment will come in later seasons)


📂 Dataset Information
Dataset Used

Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Source: Kaggle (IBM Sample Data)

Why This Dataset?

 Real business problem (customer churn prediction)

 Binary classification task (Churn: Yes / No)

 Mixed data types (numerical + categorical)

 Industry‑style features (services, billing, demographics)

 Ideal for learning data cleaning & preprocessing
